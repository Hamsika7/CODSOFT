## ðŸ“Š Code Breakdown

### ðŸŽ¯ Classes & Structures

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Book` | Structure to store book details (title, author, ISBN, status) |
| `Borrower` | Structure to store borrower information and borrowed books |
| `Library` | Main class that encapsulates all operations and data |

---
### ðŸ”§ Key Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `addBook()` | Adds a new book to the library database |
| `searchBook()` | Searches for books by title, author, or ISBN |
| `checkoutBook()` | Processes book checkout operations |
| `returnBook()` | Handles book returns and calculates any fines |
| `showBooks()` | Displays all books in the library inventory |

---
### ðŸ“œ Control Flow

1. The main loop displays the menu until the user chooses to exit
2. Each menu option calls the corresponding Library class method
3. Input validation ensures the program handles user input properly
4. Status updates provide feedback after each operation
---
### ðŸ“Š Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for search operations where n is the number of books
- **Space Complexity**: O(n+m) where n is the number of books and m is the number of borrowers
