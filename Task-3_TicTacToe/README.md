## ðŸ“Œ Features

* Two-player mode (Player 1: X, Player 2: O)
* Clear and colorful interface with ANSI color codes
* Input validation (avoids overwriting spots)
* Win detection (row, column, diagonal)
* Draw detection
* Replay option

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### ðŸ§¾ Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (like `g++`)

### ðŸ’» Steps


g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tictactoe
./tictactoe

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. The board is initialized with numbers (1-9).

2. Players take turns to enter their move (1-9).

3. The board updates with the player's symbol (X or O).

4. The game checks for:

    - Win conditions (row, column, diagonal)
  
    - Draw condition (all spots filled)

5. Players can choose to replay after each game.
